It's alive! Just a quick blog post to start off my technical blog.

I've been wanting to start a technical blog for sometime now. It will mainly consist of interesting topics or problems I've come across in my work that I feel others could benefit from. I am a husband and a father to two awesome kids (I'm also a very busy Technical Lead), so I'll post as frequently as time permits :)
