I first started programming in my early school days, first QBasic and then Turbo Pascal consumed much of my time until the end of High School.

I've been professionally programming since 2004 and started my Java development career in 2006. I have since worked in a few companies and many, many projects. I've come to specialise in Web Application development and consider myself a full stack developer and I'm generally capable of working in any area of the tech stack (HTML, CSS, JS, JS libraries, Java back end development, REST APIs, webservice integration, SQL).

In this time I've also been in the position to design many solutions from inception (some through multiple rewrites and migrations to new tech stacks). I enjoy and am involved in many aspects of Solutions Architecture,Architecture, as well as Software Engineering and Development within the projects I've been involved in.

I'm passionate about Software Engineering and I believe that it should be treated as a craft. I'm also very passionate about clean code and enjoy learning new ways to express elegant and extensible code which is easy to read and easy to maintain.

### More Information

I'm currently working for South Africa's largest privately owned Software Development company (BBD) as a Technical Lead contracting for a large telco.
